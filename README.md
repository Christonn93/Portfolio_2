Please follow the steps below:

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```

This command will install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

4. Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set, you can start the development server by running the following command:
